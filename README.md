Features: 1. Sign in/out/up; 2. blog management; 3. discussion board w report feature; 4. administration
My fav feature: everytime a blog is uploaded, the user's tree grows a branch. The branches are in a time sequence.

On the trunk are blog titles, and on the branches are posted dates.

The data of this set is managed by MySQL.
